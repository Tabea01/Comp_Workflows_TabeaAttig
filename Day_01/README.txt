Please do mainly consider "day_01_test2.ipynb", which I created at home after the course. 
I noticed that I had to run some of the commands in ubuntu in "day_01.ipynb" (during the course).
Therefore, I don't have any "output" below the code.

I tried it again at home after the course, and surprisingly got output (without changing the code, but of course with different duration of each run!). I included the different runtime of the run at uni ("day_01.ipynb") and at home ("day_01_test2.ipynb") in "day_01_test2.ipynb". Also the question "What is differential abundance analysis" is explained more in depth in "day_01_test2.ipynb".

The plots from the last task are not shown correctly here on github, which is why I also included them as png inside of the Day_01 folder:
1. boxplot.png
2. density.png
3. treatment_mCherry_hND6_sample_number.deseq2.dispersion.png
4. sample_dendrogram.png
