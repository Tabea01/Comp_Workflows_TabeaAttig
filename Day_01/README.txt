day_01.ipynb is the official assignment file, I created during the course. 
However, I noticed, that I had to run some of the commands in ubuntu.
Therefore, I don't have any "output" below the code.
I tried it again at home after the course, and surprisingly got output (without changing the code, but of course with different duration of each run!), which is why I also included "day_01_test2.ipynb", in case you want to see output.

Also, the plots from the last task are not shown correctly, which is why I also included them as png inside of the Day_01 folder:
